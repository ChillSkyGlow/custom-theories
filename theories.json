Since your work has received a bit of attention from your colleagues in the past, you decide to go into a subject not yet covered by your professor, which has interested you since day 1 of deciding to study mathematics - Complex Numbers.\nYou hope that with your research on this subject, you can finally get the breakthrough you always wanted in the scientific world.\n\nThis theory explores the world of complex numbers, their arrangement and their place in the Universe of Mathematics. The theory, named after famous mathematician Leonhard Euler, explores the relationship between exponential and trigonometric functions.\nYour task is to use this formula, and with the help of the Pythagorean theorem, to calculate the distances of cos(t) and isin(t) from the origin and grow them as large as possible using many different methods and approaches!\nA theory with interesting grow and decay rates, unusual properties, and (We hope) an interesting story!\n\nVariable Explanation:\n\nt - A simple variable based on time. Is reset on publish.\nq - A variable helping you grow ρ, directly affected by t.\na - Multiple kinds of variables, helping you grow ρ.\nb and c - Variables modifying cos(t) and isin(t)\n\nHuge thanks to:\n\n- Gilles-Philippe, for implementing integral features we proposed, helping us a *ton* during development, answering our questions and giving us beta features to use in our theories!\n\n- XLII, doing basically ALL of the balancing together with Snaeky, deciding various integral features of the theory such as, but not limited to: milestone placement, milestone costs, publication multipliers and a lot more!\n\n- Snaeky, without whom this theory would not have been possible as he was the one with the original idea of structuring a theory around Euler's Formula, and always answered my (peanut's) questions and motivated us all to push this theory forward.\n\nand of course:\n\n- The entire Discord community, who've playtested this theory and reported many bugs, especially those active in #custom-theories-dev!\n\nWe hope you enjoy playing this theory as much as we had developing it and coming up with ideas for it!\n\n- The Eulers-Formula-CT Team",

    "description": "The function now known as the Riemann zeta function was first defined by Euler for integers greater than 1 as an infinite series:\nζ(s) = 1 + 1/(2^s) + 1/(3^s) + ...\nThe definition was later extended to real numbers by Chebyshev, and to the complex plane by Riemann. However, as it diverged on all s with a real component less than or equal to 1, a special version of the function had to be defined in order to preserve the continuity of its derivatives. This is known as an analytic continuation, and the zeta function's analytic continuation relates to this infamous meme:\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... = -1/12 = ζ(-1)\n\nIn this theory, we will be examining the zeta function on the line perpendicular to the x-axis at x = 0.5, known as the critical line. In 1859, it was hypothesised by Riemann himself that, other than the so-called 'trivial zeroes' lying at negative even integers -2, -4, -6, ..., every other root of the function lies on this critical line.",

Note that this truncated product s_n approximates sin(x) better for bigger n and smaller x, in particular the approximation becomes bad for a fixed n when x gets large in the sense that the ratio s_n(x)/sin(x) diverges for x -> infty.\n\nHere, the derivative of q with respect to time is set to s_n(χ)/sin(χ) i.e. the ratio from before evaluated at χ (chi), which itself is a value depending on n.

    "description": "[副本9] Use the convergents to √2 to increase ρ. The first few convergents to √2 are as follows: 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12. N_n is the numerator of the nth convergent to √2 and D_n is the nth denominator, with 0th convergent being 1/1. In the limit, these converge to √2. The convergents oscillate above and below √2. The rate of change of q is based on the precision of the approximation.",
